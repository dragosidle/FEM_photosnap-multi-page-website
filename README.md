## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site

### Screenshot

![](./preview.gif)

<!-- Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.** -->

## My process

### Built with

<!-- - Semantic HTML5 markup -->
<!-- - CSS custom properties -->

<!-- **Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices** -->

<!-- ### What I learned -->

<!-- Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge. -->

<!-- To see how you can add code snippets, see below: -->

### Continued development

Grids haunt me as I never make use of them in any project and this one seemed to be suitable for them. I always end up using flexbox, it's something about it that makes it more fun to write, instead of defining a `grid-area` I prefer to have multiple nested flexbox items.
